# What is Charlotte?
Charlotte is a Scratch addons loader, that is designed to be flexible and extensible. Charlotte can add lots of exciting features to mostly **any** Scratch editors.

The project takes its name from the minor planet "543 Charlotte" orbiting the Sun. It was discovered by Paul GÃ¶tz on September 11, 1904, in Heidelberg.
# What is the different from ScratchAddons?
1. ScratchAddons only supports official Scratch site up to now. Charlotte supports many Scratch-based editors like ClipCC, Gandi, etc.
2. ScratchAddons is a browser extension, Charlotte is a userscript.
3. Charlotte has a different API than ScratchAddons.

# Why Charlotte?
1. More convenient dev overflow, Powered by ViolentMonkey's hot reload.
2. Charlotte's core part and addons are both written in TypeScript, which means less bugs and more stability.
3. Neat, easy-to-use Addon API

::: tip
It should be noted that Charlotte is a newer project and its stability is relatively weaker than ScratchAddons. If you only use the official Scratch website, then using ScratchAddons may be a better choice at this stage.
