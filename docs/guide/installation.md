# Installation
1. Since Charlotte is a userscript, You should make sure your browser has Userscript Manager installed. For desktop, ViolentMonkey and Tampermonkey are both ok, but we recommend ViolentMonkey since it has better development experience. For mobile, Via Browser/Kiwi Browser is a good choice.
2. Install Charlotte by clicking `charlotte.user.js` in GitHub releases.
3. All done! You can enjoy Charlotte in your favorite editors.

# Usage
...Well, maybe you also need to manage the addons you need to use. We currently offer the following solutions:

## Open Addons Modal
1. By Click '🌠 Charlotte' button at the bottom of the 'My Blocks' category. (Make sure Blockly is accessible and 'Dashboard' addon is enabled)
2. Open Browser's DevTools (usually can be opened by pressing "F12"), Checkout 'Console' tab, input `__charlotte.app.openFrontend()` then evaluate.
## Manage your addons
After opened the addons modal, You can turn on/off and configure addons. Some addons May require a refresh to be enabled or disabled.
For addon details, see [our addons](../addons/api)
