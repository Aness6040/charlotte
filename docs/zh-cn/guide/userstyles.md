# Userstyles
Userstyles are sets of CSS rules that impact Scratch pages. They can modify the appearance of both the existing UI and elements added by userscripts.   

Compared to userscripts, userstyles are relatively simple to write. All rules in userstyles will be added to the page as `<style>` when addon is activated and automatically removed when disabled.
